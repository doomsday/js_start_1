          out a <span class="highlight"> few people lately</span> with React starter tips, so I thought it would be a good idea to write some of them up
          here to share more broadly. These are all either things that I wish I'd known when I started out, or things that
          really helped me 'get' React. I'm going to assume that you know the absolute basics; if the words component, props,
          or state are unfamiliar to you, then you might want to read the official Getting started or Tutorial pages. I'm
          also going to use JSX, because it's a much more succinct and expressive syntax for writing components</p>
